title: Load Third-party Libraries
---

It's currently non-trivial to build a playground that allows you to pull in random libraries. However, the [Reason Try Page](https://reasonml.github.io/en/try.html) has ReasonReact support, specifically.

If you'd like to look into making this possible; please look [here](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io/blob/4ef19643e73edec79b1406766436571343bb2f60/README.md#build-the-playground) and ping @chenglou on Discord (note that this requires quite a bit of domain knowledge).
