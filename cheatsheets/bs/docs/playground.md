You can try BuckleScript with both the OCaml and Reason syntax displayed side-by-side, with live JS output, in the [Reason Try page](https://reasonml.github.io/en/try.html).

We also provide a vanilla [BuckleScript playground page](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript-playground/index.html).
