BuckleScript uses NPM/Yarn, so any BuckleScript library can live on https://www.npmjs.com, GitHub, locally, etc.

In general, BuckleScript packages are prefixed with `bs-` like [so](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-director). Please also put the keywords "bucklescript", "ocaml" and "reason" (if applicable) in `package.json`'s `keywords` field.

See also [reasonml-community](https://github.com/reasonml-community), the joint effort repo for some BuckleScript & Reason/OCaml libraries.
